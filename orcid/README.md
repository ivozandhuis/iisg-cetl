# Get ORCID data in an RDF graph

Simply use the bash-script `run.sh`. Here all the needed steps are performed. As long as the amount of ORCIDs is small, all the data is downloaded everytime into the `extracted\` folder.

## Add a new ORCID
Put it in the list `monitored/to_extract.txt` and run the script again.
