# Get ORCID data in an RDF graph

Simply use the bash-script ```orcid-cetl.sh```. Here all the needed steps are performed. As long as the amount of ORCIDs is small, all the data is downloaded everytime into the ```extracted``` folder.

## Add a new ORCID
Put it in the list identifiers.csv and run the script again.
